# Cash-Dispensing-Sysytem-using-Object-Oriented-Programming
This "Cash Dispensing System" repository hosts a C++ program designed to facilitate basic banking operations. Users interact with the system through a menu-driven interface, selecting options to view account balances, deposit or withdraw funds, search by account number, find the account with the highest balance, calculate the total amount in the bank, update account balances, and save account information to a file. Built upon the List class, the program offers a foundation for managing bank accounts efficiently, making it a valuable resource for developers seeking to understand or build upon banking software in C++.
